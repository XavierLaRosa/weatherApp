# BetterWeather
Created a weather iOS app called BetterWeather. Presents Xcode, Swift, CoreLocation, and DarkSky API skills. Users can access weather information for the following week using current location or manual input.

Better Weather is an iOS app that uses the DarkSky API and CoreLocation library. 
The app retrieves a varierty of weather information from today and 8 days forward.
The purpose is to create a straight forward application that gets users the information they want to see.
I plan to create more customization and a saved list of areas the user usually checks.
