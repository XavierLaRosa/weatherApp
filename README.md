## Basic Overview

Better Weather is an iOS app that uses the DarkSky API and CoreLocation library. 
The app retrieves a varierty of weather information from today and 8 days forward.
The purpose is to create a straight forward application that gets users the information they want to see.
I plan to create more customization and a saved list of areas the user usually checks.
